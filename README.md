# IslandProject

READ ME AND WEEP

Island project is an ongoing experiment playing with textures and perlin noise.

To use:
click on a segment of island and the terrain will generate around it.

The character on start is a test of coloring and styling random characters.
you can change the animation of the caracter with the keyboard arrows.

The values of the island can be tweaked, just be sure to tweak the prefab!
I have set the Terrainsize to 80 and the detail to 100,
Although i do reccomend playing a bit with detail, the larger the datail the more the map will "zoom in".
Be careful with making terrainsize too large, it is the pixel size of the texture, so it may case lag.
